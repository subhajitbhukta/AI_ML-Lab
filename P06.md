a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for digit recognition using the Keras library, and evaluate its performance. We'll use the popular MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits.

Here's the code:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Step 1: Load the MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Step 2: Normalize the input data
x_train = x_train / 255.0
x_test = x_test / 255.0

# Step 3: One-hot encode the target labels
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)

# Step 4: Build the ANN model
model = Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),  # Flatten the 28x28 images to a 1D vector of size 784
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),  # Hidden layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),   # Hidden layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Output layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) and softmax activation
])

# Step 5: Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Step 6: Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Step 7: Evaluate the model on the test set
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)

print(f'Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy}')
print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss}')

# Step 8: Predict on the first test image
predictions = model.predict(x_test)
print(f'Predicted label for the first test image: {np.argmax(predictions[0])}')
print(f'True label for the first test image: {np.argmax(y_test[0])}')
```

### Explanation of Each Step:

1. **Load the MNIST dataset**: The MNIST dataset is split into training and testing sets. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image, and the labels are the digits 0-9.
2. **Normalize the input data**: The pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.
3. **One-hot encode the target labels**: The labels are one-hot encoded to convert the class labels (0-9) into a binary matrix.
4. **Build the ANN model**: A sequential model is built with three layers:
   - `Flatten` layer to convert 2D images into 1D vectors.
   - `Dense` hidden layers with ReLU activation.
   - `Dense` output layer with softmax activation.
5. **Compile the model**: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. Accuracy is used as a metric.
6. **Train the model**: The model is trained on the training data for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a validation split of 20%.
7. **Evaluate the model**: The model is evaluated on the test set to determine the accuracy and loss.
8. **Predict on the first test image**: The model predicts the label of the first test image, and we compare it to the true label.

Running this code will train an ANN for digit recognition and print the accuracy of the model on the test set, as well as make a prediction on the first test image.
