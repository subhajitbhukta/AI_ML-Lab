To deploy a binary classification model using the given dataset and find out the score, you can use Python's `scikit-learn` library. Here, we'll use a logistic regression model for this task. Below is the step-by-step code:

1. Load the dataset.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train a logistic regression model.
4. Evaluate the model.

Here's the complete code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
data = {
    'age': [22, 25, 47, 52, 46, 56, 55, 60, 62, 61, 18, 28, 27, 29, 49, 55, 25, 58, 19, 18, 21, 26, 40, 45, 50, 54, 23],
    'bought_insurance': [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y)
X = df[['age']]
y = df['bought_insurance']

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy score
score = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy score: {score}')
```

### Explanation

1. **Loading the Dataset:** The dataset is created as a dictionary and then converted into a DataFrame using `pandas`.
2. **Splitting the Dataset:** The features (`X`) and the target (`y`) are extracted from the DataFrame. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` with 20% of the data reserved for testing.
3. **Training the Model:** A logistic regression model is initialized and trained using the training data.
4. **Predicting and Evaluating:** The model makes predictions on the test data, and the accuracy score is calculated using `accuracy_score`.

Run this code in your Python environment to train the model and get the accuracy score.
