Your updated code reads in a dataset that includes multiple features (e.g., area, bedrooms) to predict house prices. The code also handles missing values in the `bedrooms` column by filling them with the median value before fitting the Linear Regression model. Let's go through the steps and verify the approach:

1. **Data Import and Inspection**:
   - The dataset is imported from a CSV file.
   - Inspect the dataset to understand its structure.

2. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - The `bedrooms` column has missing values, which are filled with the median value of the column.

3. **Data Preparation**:
   - The dataset is split into independent variables (`new_x`) and the dependent variable (`new_y`).

4. **Model Training**:
   - A Linear Regression model is created and trained using the prepared data.
   - The model's performance is evaluated using the R^2 score.
   - The model's coefficients (slopes) and intercept (y-intercept) are extracted.

Let's correct and streamline the code, add appropriate comments, and display the results clearly:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import linear_model
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
dataUrl = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apratim777/apratim777/master/homeprices1.csv'
mca = pd.read_csv(dataUrl)

# Display the dataset
print(mca)

# Fill missing values in the 'bedrooms' column with the median value
mca.bedrooms = mca.bedrooms.fillna(mca.bedrooms.median())

# Display the dataset after filling missing values
print(mca)

# Prepare the data for the model
new_x = mca.drop('price', axis=1)  # Independent variables
new_y = mca['price']               # Dependent variable

# Create and train the Linear Regression model
reg = linear_model.LinearRegression()
reg.fit(new_x, new_y)

# Calculate the R^2 score
r2_score = reg.score(new_x, new_y)
print(f"R^2 score: {r2_score}")

# Extract and display the model coefficients and intercept
m = reg.coef_
c = reg.intercept_
print(f"Coefficients: {m}")
print(f"Intercept: {c}")
```

### Explanation:

- **Data Handling**:
  - `mca.bedrooms.fillna(mca.bedrooms.median())`: This line fills any missing values in the `bedrooms` column with the median value of that column. Note that your initial code had `mca.bedrooms = mca.bedrooms.fillna(5)`, which was replaced with the correct approach of using the median.
  
- **Model Training and Evaluation**:
  - The Linear Regression model is trained using `reg.fit(new_x, new_y)`, where `new_x` contains all the independent variables (features), and `new_y` contains the dependent variable (target).
  - The R^2 score is calculated using `reg.score(new_x, new_y)`, which provides a measure of how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
  - The coefficients and intercept of the linear model are extracted and printed.

By running this code, you will be able to train the Linear Regression model, evaluate its performance, and understand the relationship between the features and the target variable in your dataset.
